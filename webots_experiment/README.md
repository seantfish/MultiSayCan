## Notes

1. The base code for the RL navigation is by [Mehdi Shahbazi](https://github.com/MehdiShahbazi/Webots-reinforcement-navigation). The code from this repository is covered under the MIT license. Our original plan was to train an RL navigation algorithm from scratch, but due to unexpected setbacks, we opted to utilize this pretrained world. We use this as the basis for our approach.
